---TaleTeller v1.0---

An immersive e-reader.
    
Paste your story here and hit the button below! It'll make pages out of each paragraph and scroll the words on each page, making it more fun to read than a wall of text. You can add different effects too, to make dialogue stand out for example. 

Leave this field empty and hit the button to load a fun sample story (I'll update it every now and then).

Nothing submitted is uploaded anywhere, it's all saved to your browser's storage. It'll save the page you're on too, if you close it out and come back.

 - Use the buttons at the top to change pages, or click on the text to go to the next page.

 - Left/right arrow keys should work too, spacebar will go to the next page.

 ((Scroll Down))

 - Reload button on top left will clear the story to allow you to paste in a new one.

 - Play button will toggle auto-advancing to the next page after a delay.
 
 - Fullscreen button on top right will do what it's supposed to, unless it doesn't.

 - Options has a bunch of fun and useful things.
 
 - Works pretty horribly on mobile, working on it.

 - I'll try my best not to break your custom settings and saved stories as I'm updating, but if they're messed up and refreshing doesn't work try going to Options -> Extras and clear all cache.
 
 TODO: Create a chrome extension to make copying and loading new stories from your favorite sites way easier.

 MORE IDEAS: 
 - Allow for custom user fonts (like from Google fonts). 
 - Have share story links contain custom themes (so like you open a story link for a spooky story, it overrides your settings and makes the loaded story look spooky)
 - Background effects? Rain, snow, nuclear fallout, etc.

Made by Carter, carter@taleteller.io, send feedback and stories I could add as samples!
