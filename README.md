Paste your story here and hit the button below! It'll make pages out of each paragraph and scroll the words on each page, making it more immersive and fun to read than a wall of text. You can add different effects too, to make dialogue stand out for example. 

Nothing submitted is uploaded anywhere, it's all saved to your browser's storage.

 - Use the buttons at the top to change pages, or click on the text to go to the next page.

 - Left/right arrow keys should work too, spacebar will go to the next page.

 - Reload button on top left will clear the story to allow you to paste in a new one.

 - Play button will toggle auto-advancing to the next page after a delay.
 
 - Fullscreen button on top right will do what it's supposed to, unless it doesn't.

 ((SCROLL DOWN))

 - Options has a bunch of fun and useful things (WIP).
 
 - Works pretty horribly on mobile, I'll make it better sometime.

 - I'll try my best not to break your custom settings and saved stories as I'm updating, but if they're messed up and refreshing doesn't work try going to Options -> Extras and purge local storage.
 
 TODO: Finish up Options menu, create a chrome extension to make copying and loading stories easier.
